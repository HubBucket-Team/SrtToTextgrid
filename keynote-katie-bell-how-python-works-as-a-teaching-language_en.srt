2
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
but I&#39;d like to introduce you to our
keynote speaker this morning

3
00:00:04 --> 00:00:14
katie is not yet katie is a former
software developer for Google many years

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:20
ago veteran run there and left there
recently to join a Sydney based startup

5
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
named Brock learning working with high
school is building a platform for

6
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
programming in education something like
that I think I tangled up a few have

7
00:00:27 --> 00:00:32
sentences but I will hand directly over
her so that I won&#39;t keep missing my

8
00:00:32 --> 00:00:45
words around the password email please
do you work for a company called cloning

9
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
and to give you an explanation of what
we do it gonna take you through thinking

10
00:00:51 --> 00:00:55
like a non programa approaching
programming and prices for the very

11
00:00:55 --> 00:01:01
first time and the way our platform
works as we have an online system it

12
00:01:01 --> 00:01:04
teaches you everything you need to know
about the pipeline in order to do a

13
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
serious challenge questions

14
00:01:06 --> 00:01:10
challenge questions start off
extraordinarily easy with our world and

15
00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
similar kinds of variations before we
move on to the first kind of scary

16
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
complicated question where you&#39;re
supposed to write a name that are right

17
00:01:17 --> 00:01:22
and I write a program that asks the user
what is your name and use it and typing

18
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
something and it should say color to the
user with whatever name they use a typed

19
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
in her things they could write this
program

20
00:01:30 --> 00:01:38
good stuff we&#39;re gonna go through the
sort of series of thought processes that

21
00:01:38 --> 00:01:44
one of our students Danish dotted with
star is the first attempt to serve the

22
00:01:44 --> 00:01:49
system works as you write in your
attempt at this program and then you can

23
00:01:49 --> 00:01:52
hit you can run it yourself you can see
that it works the way you expected to

24
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
work and then you can hit the mark
button that runs through a series of

25
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
tests to give you feedback and hope you
point to help point you in the right

26
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
direction for eventually getting the
question corrects are famous in this

27
00:02:03 --> 00:02:08
case copied exactly one of the examples
from the North that had been reading

28
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
through reaches during the student
actually read the notes to good start

29
00:02:12 --> 00:02:17
but that doesn&#39;t really answer the
question your program doesn&#39;t really

30
00:02:17 --> 00:02:22
work it says hello and 10 when it&#39;s
meant to say what is your name

31
00:02:22 --> 00:02:27
next attempt getting much closer even
like reading in the input into a

32
00:02:27 --> 00:02:33
variable printing it out pretty good but
it&#39;s still not exactly right and we

33
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
emphasize this right from the beginning
in our costs that you must be very

34
00:02:36 --> 00:02:42
precise and we&#39;ll get to that mistake
carry this time we&#39;ve got the space

35
00:02:42 --> 00:02:49
after the question mark that&#39;s a good
step right now our deviantART yeah not

36
00:02:49 --> 00:02:55
not quite getting what&#39;s going on here
but you know it&#39;s printing out some

37
00:02:55 --> 00:03:01
extra staff yeah

38
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
is getting a little bit confused and
we&#39;re learning from this game is

39
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09
learning firstly the computers of stupid
does not understand what it means when

40
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
he says I&#39;m Hamish

41
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
computers require precision is learning
to put spaces in the right places

42
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
learning that the output needs to be
exact

43
00:03:19 --> 00:03:26
we have another couple more attempts
getting closer just got the space on

44
00:03:26 --> 00:03:33
their ok I know it fails the second test
case publicly well as long as you type

45
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
in your name is broke and it doesn&#39;t
work at all if you type in anything else

46
00:03:37 --> 00:03:42
and sore alright so the programs meant
to put further now ok

47
00:03:42 --> 00:03:53
but now it&#39;s meant to put broke her
sometime we missed again and then

48
00:03:53 --> 00:04:02
eventually we get there this is kind of
demonstrating how someone who has never

49
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
understood how a computer works how
programming works approaching it for the

50
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
first time this sort of learning mostly
the computers are stupid but they also

51
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
have to respond to different kinds of
input when I type in something different

52
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
the program has a series of rules which
would then respond mister and that&#39;s

53
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
kind of the fundamental piece of how
programming works

54
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
other questions are getting rid of the
user interface around that this is the

55
00:04:26 --> 00:04:32
question yes is the answer that we
expect it&#39;s moving on this is after week

56
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
one you&#39;ve gotten through multiple
things you want if statements of London

57
00:04:34 --> 00:04:39
Mile Rd 114 words we&#39;re starting to put
them all together as a sort of five

58
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
weeks later and I&#39;ll call us this is a
much more complicated example we&#39;re

59
00:04:42 --> 00:04:47
reading in one line of input at a time
sending it to a list reversing the list

60
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
and then printing it out and report the
best order this is my favorite attempt

61
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
to one of these questions it&#39;s not doubt
by and got a while if it&#39;s gonna get in

62
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
for some reason it&#39;s also counting how
many things that I think to the wild why

63
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
is that this is how it went

64
00:05:00 --> 00:05:09
part of learning to program the students
are also going to learn that they should

65
00:05:09 --> 00:05:12
be avoiding unnecessary repetition
because eventually this doesn&#39;t work as

66
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
well computers a good at the good
repeating things over and over again so

67
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
that you don&#39;t have to I tried to find
an example of its done and getting mixed

68
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
off the ballot different data types
caused this is one of the things that

69
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
really really cool students when they&#39;re
starting out with Python and this was

70
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
the person who kind of got that there&#39;s
something wrong with trying to like a

71
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
cancer pract strings but haven&#39;t quite
worked out that they&#39;re already strings

72
00:05:34 --> 00:05:42
and that bring a firing them is not
actually gonna help but question one of

73
00:05:42 --> 00:05:48
the students are learning that the data
has a structure to it and computing like

74
00:05:48 --> 00:05:52
a string is fundamentally a different
thing to an integer and so on and as we

75
00:05:52 --> 00:05:56
learn lists are more complicated
structures and stuff why we didn&#39;t

76
00:05:56 --> 00:06:01
hurting who has heard this before
quitting is the new literacy it&#39;s also

77
00:06:01 --> 00:06:08
complete crap I I get really annoyed
when people share this kind of thing is

78
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
the new literacy everyone is gonna need
to be able to code or you won&#39;t be able

79
00:06:11 --> 00:06:17
to get a job that sounds like a really
terrible plan to me I don&#39;t want to have

80
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
every person in the world karting that&#39;s
going to end up with a lot of crappy and

81
00:06:20 --> 00:06:29
redundant kurd when we&#39;re talking about
how everyone covered why is it that we

82
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
actually want everyone to learn to
current we definitely don&#39;t want

83
00:06:32 --> 00:06:37
everyone to be programmers we need a lot
of people to do other things as well and

84
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
again we don&#39;t want everyone writing
copy code we should be able to write the

85
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
card once and then it should be used
multiple times we shouldn&#39;t have

86
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
everyone ready so I propose that we
change this instead of talking about

87
00:06:47 --> 00:06:52
creating is the new literacy should make
hurting is the new biology

88
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
before you like what the hell let me
explain that a little bit so when you

89
00:06:56 --> 00:06:57
study biology at school

90
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
firstly you thought studying yet in
primary school you start with really

91
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
simple things you grow a little broad
beans or heads of grass and stuff and

92
00:07:04 --> 00:07:08
you see that plants need water and finds
needs online and as you get older you

93
00:07:08 --> 00:07:12
start to understand that a lot more you
learn about photosynthesis you learn

94
00:07:12 --> 00:07:17
this is why if we don&#39;t give any plans
any sunlight is going to die or get

95
00:07:17 --> 00:07:22
water those are not going to survive
very long in make sense of the world

96
00:07:22 --> 00:07:28
around you and then you can reason about
it you have part of being an intelligent

97
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
human being and society&#39;s understanding
how border synthesis works how we get

98
00:07:31 --> 00:07:35
food every day how we don&#39;t talk in the
same way

99
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
understanding how computer works is
fundamental to be able to use them well

100
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
to be able to being able to reason about
them in society to be able to make

101
00:07:42 --> 00:07:49
intelligent decisions as of when
technical issues come up things going

102
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
back to what our students with learning
as it was starting to program their

103
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
learning that there are limitations to
what computers can do they can only do

104
00:07:56 --> 00:08:01
follow a series of roles based on the
inputs that are given if you could

105
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
imagine how much easier tech support
would be if everything we understood

106
00:08:04 --> 00:08:09
this if you could they understand that
the purpose of computers is to avoid

107
00:08:09 --> 00:08:14
work for humans if you understand what a
computer is capable of doing you are

108
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
able to sit back and wait wait a minute
why am i doing a job that could be

109
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
replaced by a computer you don&#39;t need to
be a professional coda to have enough

110
00:08:22 --> 00:08:30
understanding to be able to see that for
every every student should learn to

111
00:08:30 --> 00:08:35
procured at school during school and
this helps not only like attract more

112
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
programmers to the field because more
people will become interested in

113
00:08:38 --> 00:08:43
programming this also helps fields which
are very likely to need quarters finance

114
00:08:43 --> 00:08:43
and science

115
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
engineering where if you study physics
these days we study physics at school we

116
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
study physics University and you start
doing research and discover that you

117
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
need to be able to colored in order to
do that research and then you have a

118
00:08:52 --> 00:08:57
crash course including a lot of visitors
would be terrible courage learning that

119
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
earlier would then help us build that do
actually require courting it also helps

120
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
every other fuel because people will be
able to see how computers fit in how

121
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
computer programming fits in what kind
of tools they can use water is available

122
00:09:08 --> 00:09:09
to them

123
00:09:09 --> 00:09:14
it also helps increase of eighty you end
up in the current system where students

124
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
will learn to Cardiff for some reason
they are expecting that they will find

125
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
it interesting and they choose to then
learn about it if you start off with

126
00:09:20 --> 00:09:24
every single child learning about it
every single child the opportunity to

127
00:09:24 --> 00:09:28
find out if it&#39;s something that they&#39;re
interested in this helps women this

128
00:09:28 --> 00:09:35
helps minorities is generally a good
thing let&#39;s give this a little bit more

129
00:09:35 --> 00:09:41
structure we&#39;re going to dive in to help
this actually looks out of school level

130
00:09:41 --> 00:09:47
when you&#39;re teaching according two
examples in a look at the UK curriculum

131
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
and the new Australian Curriculum that&#39;s
coming out in the next couple of years

132
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
my understanding is that in New Zealand
at the moment in the curriculum for

133
00:09:54 --> 00:10:00
karting is a and optional sort of higher
later and a high school kind of thing

134
00:10:00 --> 00:10:06
there&#39;s nothing for earlier on this is a
very high level summary of the UK coding

135
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
curriculum and this came out

136
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
already lot of teachers are freaking out
because they don&#39;t know how to cook

137
00:10:12 --> 00:10:16
teach programming as they don&#39;t know how
to program them self but they&#39;re working

138
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
on it for notice that the stocks really
really done at the top

139
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
died 15 and six year olds starting to
think about

140
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
algorithms and computational thinking so
this doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re getting

141
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
five year olds to start cutting
entitlement cuz they can barely read get

142
00:10:31 --> 00:10:37
but we are starting to get five and
six-year-old to think about things in a

143
00:10:37 --> 00:10:42
computational thinking kind of way how
do I explain in a structured way how to

144
00:10:42 --> 00:10:45
make person in the morning what are the
decisions I make you can start to think

145
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
about branching decisions when he thinks
if it is raining then I should take an

146
00:10:48 --> 00:10:55
umbrella otherwise I should bring a half
discussing things and developing those

147
00:10:55 --> 00:10:59
algorithms in series of steps and
instructions and also stopped to talk

148
00:10:59 --> 00:11:04
about using technology and kind of what
it means when you&#39;re creating dollars

149
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
are creating storing retrieving digital
data could be very simple like taking a

150
00:11:07 --> 00:11:13
four German saving it to drive somewhere
and then sending it to someone else when

151
00:11:13 --> 00:11:18
you get to the sort of year seven to
eleven year old age group that&#39;s when

152
00:11:18 --> 00:11:24
they stopped actually writing programs
and in the UK this is usually done with

153
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
Mike scratch and computer programming
language where they&#39;re starting to write

154
00:11:27 --> 00:11:30
programs would actually have to think I
can I want the freedom to do this they

155
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
come up with a series of instructions
and steps introduce variable your dude

156
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
ranching they&#39;re starting to learn that
there&#39;s also things in there about how

157
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
networks and the Internet

158
00:11:38 --> 00:11:43
how computers didn&#39;t realize is also a
staff throughout the curriculum on using

159
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
the internet safely and using impact of
technology on society and sort of funny

160
00:11:47 --> 00:11:53
things like that as well keep on getting
into the other kids which is sort of

161
00:11:53 --> 00:11:58
214 they have to learn to different
programming languages and at least one

162
00:11:58 --> 00:12:04
of them has to be a text based
programming language and in the UK this

163
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
is almost always packed them it is
incredibly common to be teaching in

164
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
schools in the UK at the moment there&#39;s
also a particular things in the

165
00:12:11 --> 00:12:16
curriculum about running Boolean logic
and operated is how hardware and

166
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
software how computers work that they
have a series of instructions that they

167
00:12:19 --> 00:12:24
are executing one by one daughter is
represented in finery moving on to the

168
00:12:24 --> 00:12:29
Australian Curriculum this is the
structure there&#39;s a much like again

169
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
these are very very light condensed
versions of the curriculum is a lot of

170
00:12:32 --> 00:12:38
texts in their room is divided into
separate in some sort of course streams

171
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
these are the two of them there is a
couple more but starting in after too

172
00:12:42 --> 00:12:48
much in the New Zealand system would be
one to grade 12 30 again donning

173
00:12:48 --> 00:12:53
describing algorithms wanting to
identify the digital systems that you&#39;re

174
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
using every day starting to the really
basic things that you can do in a

175
00:12:56 --> 00:13:01
classroom with a teacher and just paper
and whitewater and stop not even

176
00:13:01 --> 00:13:07
touching a computer at this point I&#39;m
has a little bit more detail and then

177
00:13:07 --> 00:13:11
the UK curriculum and goes into more
detail specific about how data is stored

178
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
and represented in numbers and inquiry
and how getting onto the later ones I&#39;ll

179
00:13:15 --> 00:13:22
text and images and sound daughter is
represented but the progression for

180
00:13:22 --> 00:13:26
programming is very similar to the UK
system where you start out again with

181
00:13:26 --> 00:13:30
the very young kids describing
algorithms then for this sort of primary

182
00:13:30 --> 00:13:34
school age kids you&#39;re using a visual
programming language starting off with

183
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
import and doing if statements and then
getting too complicated things like

184
00:13:37 --> 00:13:44
loops but again which in the New Zealand
system would be here at nine

185
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
a general-purpose programming language
and again the curriculum is very

186
00:13:48 --> 00:13:53
language neutral but you can see how I
think it fit in there are talking about

187
00:13:53 --> 00:14:02
Biden why would we teach in schools as
opposed to any other language and I

188
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
really enjoyed reading about them is
definitely a good language for teaching

189
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
and it&#39;s essentially good for the same
reasons that you guys are like by then

190
00:14:08 --> 00:14:14
because it is very clean and simple
especially when you get started you

191
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
imagine this program in Java when you
have classes and stuff is a hell of a

192
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
lot of stuff that you have to explain
away or ignore as you&#39;re getting started

193
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
and your vote in your first programs

194
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
the other thing I could do you like
about my son is demonstrated by this

195
00:14:26 --> 00:14:33
example for can anyone see the problem
with this problem is that it&#39;s invited

196
00:14:33 --> 00:14:34
to

197
00:14:34 --> 00:14:39
never ever teach by center and this is
probably my favorite reason why you can

198
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
see the bug with this yes I cable had
this before

199
00:14:43 --> 00:14:54
yes for a bigger than a thousand the
variable here is a string and invite

200
00:14:54 --> 00:14:57
them to you can compare string to a
number and it just kind of works except

201
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
it only works if it happens to the
number happens to be greater than the

202
00:15:01 --> 00:15:06
number three

203
00:15:06 --> 00:15:12
I cannot like describe to you how many
times I am seeing students bashing my

204
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
head against the wall like why does my
if statement work only if the number is

205
00:15:15 --> 00:15:22
less than the other number and this is
what I like about Python particularly

206
00:15:22 --> 00:15:29
3 never ever treatment center is because
it had a lot of thought put into it to

207
00:15:29 --> 00:15:34
make it clean and consistent and nice if
you&#39;ve tried teaching JavaScript in this

208
00:15:34 --> 00:15:38
is what the random little gotchas in
there is much nicer this makes it a

209
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
great degree good teaching language
again for the same reason that you guys

210
00:15:40 --> 00:15:45
and pricing and serve as mentioned
before this is really where it fits in

211
00:15:45 --> 00:15:50
nicely in the UK curriculum and again
this is where it fits in nicely with the

212
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
Australian Curriculum as well

213
00:15:51 --> 00:15:56
New Zealand is usually a little bit
ahead of Australia and everything but I

214
00:15:56 --> 00:16:04
ok this is the problem with bison
reaching by then what is this I don&#39;t

215
00:16:04 --> 00:16:11
hear is the idle at some point in time I
K who actually uses it for anything

216
00:16:11 --> 00:16:21
useful because did anyone hear work on I
don&#39;t at all good I can I can safely I

217
00:16:21 --> 00:16:27
can say I don&#39;t have really enjoyed it
not only looks like it&#39;s also even works

218
00:16:27 --> 00:16:31
on a Mac it&#39;s kind of painful two years
in the interpreter you can even use the

219
00:16:31 --> 00:16:36
Opera to get back to your previous
commands but if you go into schools and

220
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
you see them taking part in this is
almost always what they&#39;re using and it

221
00:16:39 --> 00:16:45
kind of terrible thing we decided to put
everything on line so we built our art

222
00:16:45 --> 00:16:51
is better and nicer but it does have the
disadvantage that it is online you can&#39;t

223
00:16:51 --> 00:16:55
necessarily do Pi Day maps for the for
example because all of the packing is

224
00:16:55 --> 00:16:59
running on a free service and you can&#39;t
really getting you are doing stuff

225
00:16:59 --> 00:17:04
likely idol is the kind of choice and
that&#39;s not particularly great but there

226
00:17:04 --> 00:17:09
are a lot of really really cool things
that people are using foreign teaching

227
00:17:09 --> 00:17:12
with prices are going to go through a
couple of areas because they&#39;re they&#39;re

228
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
really cool examples of what you can do
for the Raspberry Pi foundation has a

229
00:17:16 --> 00:17:21
lot of activities that newspaper with
the robbery this one is one of the

230
00:17:21 --> 00:17:25
examples where you hook up a little tiny
camera and a button and courting early

231
00:17:25 --> 00:17:28
in Python you can write the current that
if you hit the button and it will take a

232
00:17:28 --> 00:17:31
further when it will store it and you
can use this to make little stop motion

233
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
video can seem to love this thing you
can do

234
00:17:34 --> 00:17:39
electronics programming with Python
which is pretty awesome that&#39;s a really

235
00:17:39 --> 00:17:43
good way to get kids doing something
hands on something it&#39;s interactive you

236
00:17:43 --> 00:17:46
there is a pipe an API for Minecraft

237
00:17:46 --> 00:17:51
which lets you place box office is also
really cool and engaging for kids this

238
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
is usually designed to run on the rock
group I but there&#39;s can also run on the

239
00:17:54 --> 00:18:00
regular my profession as well one of the
things that we launched recently cloning

240
00:18:00 --> 00:18:04
is using dental records or longer
depending on what generation to

241
00:18:04 --> 00:18:09
compromise and this is one for very very
beginning programming stuff where you

242
00:18:09 --> 00:18:12
can actually sort of cedar as old as I
am moving the total and it&#39;s turning

243
00:18:12 --> 00:18:18
left and right and you can draw pretty
pictures and stuff with it and there&#39;s

244
00:18:18 --> 00:18:23
always my game which seems to end up
looking like this but it is very

245
00:18:23 --> 00:18:26
exciting for kids to have like stuff to
draw on the screen off the downside of

246
00:18:26 --> 00:18:31
Pi game is that there is a lot that you
have to come up to even get started and

247
00:18:31 --> 00:18:34
doing anything is kind of a little bit
painful like yes ok I need to work out

248
00:18:34 --> 00:18:37
the coordinates and all this image on
the screen and that&#39;s exactly what could

249
00:18:37 --> 00:18:44
be a bit nicer but it is very sorry this
is an explanation that I get to be

250
00:18:44 --> 00:18:46
polite when I talking about what we
should do this to get kids excited

251
00:18:46 --> 00:18:50
turned out different kids get excited
about different things and so when

252
00:18:50 --> 00:18:53
teaching programming there these are the
three different kind of major areas that

253
00:18:53 --> 00:18:57
I see kids get excited about when
they&#39;re learning to get excited purely

254
00:18:57 --> 00:19:01
about the algorithmic problem solving
steps where they don&#39;t really care what

255
00:19:01 --> 00:19:03
the code is actually doing as long as
they&#39;re like enjoying the thought

256
00:19:03 --> 00:19:06
process of I have to do this thing and
now how do I formulate that encouraged

257
00:19:06 --> 00:19:09
to make it to the thing that I want some
kids get excited

258
00:19:09 --> 00:19:13
learning how computers actually work
learning what is going on and sort of

259
00:19:13 --> 00:19:16
doing things that are very low level
those kids tend to gravitate more to the

260
00:19:16 --> 00:19:21
electronics and robotics kind of stuff
and then there&#39;s kind of the the

261
00:19:21 --> 00:19:25
building cool stuff kids who they don&#39;t
kind of like what the process is to get

262
00:19:25 --> 00:19:27
there but they want something that they
can really show off at the end

263
00:19:27 --> 00:19:32
and this is kind of the difficult part
for pythons are about them all the cool

264
00:19:32 --> 00:19:35
stuff that I just knew that you can take
your place then the problem with all of

265
00:19:35 --> 00:19:37
the doors is that they are very much

266
00:19:37 --> 00:19:41
toys they are not real world
applications and it works really really

267
00:19:41 --> 00:19:46
well for the younger primary school age
kids but when I&#39;m getting older we need

268
00:19:46 --> 00:19:50
something to then bring that back
together and sure hey you just want a

269
00:19:50 --> 00:19:55
real-world skills that can build the
kinds of software that you use your self

270
00:19:55 --> 00:20:01
everyday they want to learn a skill that
I could use to build something that will

271
00:20:01 --> 00:20:05
actually genuinely be useful in my life
that people might actually want to use

272
00:20:05 --> 00:20:10
it could be a product so my question to
you is where is running so if you guys

273
00:20:10 --> 00:20:15
are all by the developers put your hand
up your code is running in some way that

274
00:20:15 --> 00:20:21
is useful to a person other than you got
it running somewhere it&#39;s in its

275
00:20:21 --> 00:20:26
introduction its launch to the user ok
so put your hand up again if your card

276
00:20:26 --> 00:20:32
is not running on your own servers
somewhere ok is it actually running on a

277
00:20:32 --> 00:20:35
desktop device or mobile device

278
00:20:35 --> 00:20:40
a couple of you actually more than I
expected I did interesting as I

279
00:20:40 --> 00:20:45
experienced developers do is run on
Linux service somewhere in the crowd

280
00:20:45 --> 00:20:52
somewhere as some kind of web server
like this and it&#39;s very hard to find

281
00:20:52 --> 00:20:58
ways to use pythons to develop the kinds
of apps and tools that the kids actually

282
00:20:58 --> 00:21:04
no runs the ones that they using the
kids nor I have this out that I install

283
00:21:04 --> 00:21:08
my foreign or there is a software that I
can run on my computer as a game or

284
00:21:08 --> 00:21:08
something

285
00:21:08 --> 00:21:12
these are the sort of tangible software
pieces that they&#39;re familiar with and if

286
00:21:12 --> 00:21:17
they could build boers they could really
see the value of what they&#39;re doing the

287
00:21:17 --> 00:21:21
way we&#39;ve gone around this in the past
is by getting kids to use Python to

288
00:21:21 --> 00:21:26
build a website to build a website which
is interactive and they and they can I

289
00:21:26 --> 00:21:30
take things into forms and then asuras
but the downside of this is that is

290
00:21:30 --> 00:21:34
actually a really huge project to get
anything working if you wanted to be

291
00:21:34 --> 00:21:38
able to write I can web server other
need to understand HTML any to

292
00:21:38 --> 00:21:42
understand CSS if it wants to look not
like crap they need to understand how

293
00:21:42 --> 00:21:45
HTTP works and you need some kind of
database for storing stuff in there

294
00:21:45 --> 00:21:48
usually that would be some kind of SQL
database and so you&#39;re suddenly teaching

295
00:21:48 --> 00:21:57
for different kinds of writing and SQL
in order just to get something working

296
00:21:57 --> 00:22:05
that looks like a website that was made
ten years ago because JavaScript if you

297
00:22:05 --> 00:22:09
want jobs good you have to learn another
language how do we do this and I have

298
00:22:09 --> 00:22:13
seen this work in schools where you have
a particularly motivated teacher that

299
00:22:13 --> 00:22:16
actually understands all of these
different things themselves I can guide

300
00:22:16 --> 00:22:23
the students through that but business
mostly the time completely invisible for

301
00:22:23 --> 00:22:35
schools we are this is kind of my my
challenge to you guys if we have kids

302
00:22:35 --> 00:22:39
and we have teachers coming to us and
saying I want to build an app can I do

303
00:22:39 --> 00:22:40
that with piping

304
00:22:40 --> 00:22:44
well maybe

305
00:22:44 --> 00:22:49
we want kids that I want to build a game
and I just want to be able to send that

306
00:22:49 --> 00:22:53
to my friends and then they can run and
play it well I guess you could packages

307
00:22:53 --> 00:22:59
and I&#39;ll let you guess which one of
these comes from a teacher teaching

308
00:22:59 --> 00:23:04
python is like getting into it and they
really excited but like we need

309
00:23:04 --> 00:23:09
something that is visually engaging that
then they can they can build interactive

310
00:23:09 --> 00:23:13
things and stuff and this is really hard
and fight them so this is my chance to

311
00:23:13 --> 00:23:15
hear this week

312
00:23:15 --> 00:23:22
replace idle and make it better idk he
also some kind of simple and powerful

313
00:23:22 --> 00:23:26
graphical interface toolkit where I can
just kind of drawer button and then

314
00:23:26 --> 00:23:29
write very very simple card so I can
click that button and something happens

315
00:23:29 --> 00:23:34
that would be awesome to make pipe work
on profile there are some projects

316
00:23:34 --> 00:23:37
already underway for this would look
really cool so I&#39;m excited about that

317
00:23:37 --> 00:23:43
but I would not recommend and one thing
that I thought would be particularly

318
00:23:43 --> 00:23:47
cool coming from you Zealand as I
understand that my phone is the

319
00:23:47 --> 00:23:51
scripting language for pretty much all
3d animations golf but I&#39;ve never seen

320
00:23:51 --> 00:23:56
anyone make this work in a classroom
where you have a bunch of kids like that

321
00:23:56 --> 00:24:02
would be a very cool very interactive
real-world application of pattern but

322
00:24:02 --> 00:24:04
I&#39;ve not seen anyone do this certainly
was working the 3d animation industry

323
00:24:04 --> 00:24:14
talk to me afterwards we have liked to
have contact with a lot of different

324
00:24:14 --> 00:24:18
ages and get the feedback if we loving
learning Python the kids are getting

325
00:24:18 --> 00:24:20
really into it what can we do next

326
00:24:20 --> 00:24:29
apart from that we really need advocates
advocates boreddd including in schools

327
00:24:29 --> 00:24:32
and not only light even if we do get
courting toward in schools in order to

328
00:24:32 --> 00:24:36
get a generation of kids that actually
understand computers coming through the

329
00:24:36 --> 00:24:38
teachers are going to need a lot of help

330
00:24:38 --> 00:24:44
for anything that you can do to help
train teachers to lunch program to

331
00:24:44 --> 00:24:49
program and to teach programming is
gonna be really valuable I tend to try

332
00:24:49 --> 00:24:53
and shy away from quitting clubs where
the kids are choosing to go and be there

333
00:24:53 --> 00:24:56
because you&#39;re usually only getting the
kids that are already interested in

334
00:24:56 --> 00:24:59
learning to card I could maybe do it in
this bed time with their parents are

335
00:24:59 --> 00:25:04
computer scientist running a workshop in
the school we&#39;re taking a whole class is

336
00:25:04 --> 00:25:06
much more valuable cause and there&#39;s a
whole ton of kids that never would have

337
00:25:06 --> 00:25:10
understood programming it all before
that then getting exposure to it or

338
00:25:10 --> 00:25:13
become a teacher who then become
teachers also right goals in your

339
00:25:13 --> 00:25:18
actually have skills in the classroom as
well as we don&#39;t think I might have

340
00:25:18 --> 00:25:21
talked a little bit too fast

341
00:25:21 --> 00:25:27
Crescent Creek

342
00:25:27 --> 00:26:26
for the last 16 years and online Python
programming competition which also

343
00:26:26 --> 00:26:30
teaches bison in order to reach a lot
more kids and I was wanting to reach the

344
00:26:30 --> 00:26:36
order of ten thousand kids every year
2012 to expand this war but wasn&#39;t

345
00:26:36 --> 00:26:41
getting enough backing from the
University this is why grow cloning

346
00:26:41 --> 00:26:49
started as a separate company is a tiny
for-profit company where we charge $20

347
00:26:49 --> 00:26:56
per student to an online and that is
where the money comes from

348
00:26:56 --> 00:27:00
thank you for your presentation

349
00:27:00 --> 00:27:04
my question is I went to my kid in
school and told the principal and I

350
00:27:04 --> 00:27:08
would like to run a Linux I will check
out some state and the principal told me

351
00:27:08 --> 00:27:11
that she has to go to some Department of
Education getting permission and this is

352
00:27:11 --> 00:27:16
all red tape blocked my proposal at that
time in geneva came back to me so my

353
00:27:16 --> 00:27:20
question to you is that what the local
you may have already somewhat shops in

354
00:27:20 --> 00:27:24
the school how do you approach in can
you be put to put some light on the

355
00:27:24 --> 00:27:33
police forces that you need to go
through to have a background check and

356
00:27:33 --> 00:27:37
stuff done to be ok

357
00:27:37 --> 00:27:42
apartment all you really need is a
provision of the school I&#39;m not sure

358
00:27:42 --> 00:27:55
what else would mean so I worked in the
school system admin but you don&#39;t

359
00:27:55 --> 00:28:00
discover I&#39;m working as that are used to
study and so they basically said goodbye

360
00:28:00 --> 00:28:03
to Japan of pushing into programming
that&#39;s why I&#39;m sorry governor in this

361
00:28:03 --> 00:28:10
then you guys but I found there&#39;s a lot
of like you know I&#39;m out is it does a

362
00:28:10 --> 00:28:13
lot of you know a lot of effort into
teaching as programming and after being

363
00:28:13 --> 00:28:18
unified model of kids don&#39;t even run
half what we learned in our in our

364
00:28:18 --> 00:28:22
program and it&#39;s very hard to encourage
teachers to learn new stuff they&#39;re just

365
00:28:22 --> 00:28:26
trying to encourage outage due to launch
it because I&#39;m sick of looking six

366
00:28:26 --> 00:28:30
versions of the same pitch because it&#39;s
just horrible so how do you encourage

367
00:28:30 --> 00:28:34
teachers to do lunch programs that
encourage them to stop learning how to

368
00:28:34 --> 00:28:37
do a freaking PowerPoint presentations
and look at something interesting

369
00:28:37 --> 00:28:39
those kids are suffering from the fact
that you just don&#39;t want to do anything

370
00:28:39 --> 00:28:40
about that fact

371
00:28:40 --> 00:28:47
there&#39;s not a lot you can do to make
someone learn something new and

372
00:28:47 --> 00:28:50
different way to what they were doing it
before every year every kind of industry

373
00:28:50 --> 00:28:53
not just teachers like getting out of
the pattern of that what you were in

374
00:28:53 --> 00:28:57
before this is a big problem because
we&#39;re coming in particular because you

375
00:28:57 --> 00:28:59
get some kids that have been occurring
since they were 8 years old and they

376
00:28:59 --> 00:29:05
have like 40 they get to university and
the like why we went over and you get

377
00:29:05 --> 00:29:07
all the kids that have no idea what
programming is good they&#39;ve never seen

378
00:29:07 --> 00:29:12
it before and you have this huge
disparity yeah this is exactly the kind

379
00:29:12 --> 00:29:15
of problem that having a fit curriculum
across all schools is designed to solve

380
00:29:15 --> 00:29:19
USA essentially define this is the
minimum standard that we expect students

381
00:29:19 --> 00:29:24
to achieve at school curriculum this is
I don&#39;t see any way to actually get

382
00:29:24 --> 00:29:26
cruising toward in schools without it
being part of the mandated curriculum

383
00:29:26 --> 00:29:31
you can encourage and you can sort of
pride as much as you want and they don&#39;t

384
00:29:31 --> 00:29:33
worry you don&#39;t have to teach it I can
come to your school when he did or

385
00:29:33 --> 00:29:37
something like that but ultimately
you&#39;re never going to get this in every

386
00:29:37 --> 00:29:47
school everywhere unless it is enforced
my question to you is you said

387
00:29:47 --> 00:29:52
we need a better idea what is the use
cases often I D

388
00:29:52 --> 00:29:58
when I learn Python that I found it much
more useful to just use a good at a text

389
00:29:58 --> 00:30:04
editor and Python maybe I python is a
shell to toy around with but I never

390
00:30:04 --> 00:30:09
needed something more than a decent text
editor so that it is an interesting

391
00:30:09 --> 00:30:13
point as an I seen this occasionally
where a student becomes a lot more

392
00:30:13 --> 00:30:16
engaged when they use the command line
when they using some kind of

393
00:30:16 --> 00:30:24
pre-packaged I D but ultimately it&#39;s
less scary when you&#39;re first starting

394
00:30:24 --> 00:30:28
out if you have sort of a all the
information that you need in one place

395
00:30:28 --> 00:30:33
kids are typically bad typing their bad
at switching between different winners

396
00:30:33 --> 00:30:36
and managing all that kind of muscle
memory typing between different winners

397
00:30:36 --> 00:30:39
and stuff isn&#39;t something that you
haven&#39;t primary school and sore even

398
00:30:39 --> 00:30:42
idle where you have two different
winners were you have a different winner

399
00:30:42 --> 00:30:45
for your text editor in a different
window for your interpreter gets really

400
00:30:45 --> 00:30:47
confusing for kids and i&#39;ve seen this
happen

401
00:30:47 --> 00:30:51
having some kind of whom were you have
here is my current and here is the code

402
00:30:51 --> 00:30:56
running and I can see both at the same
time is useful and it will highlight a

403
00:30:56 --> 00:31:01
particular line when you&#39;ve got some
time there or something but there is a

404
00:31:01 --> 00:31:05
lot of value in having an IV and making
those initial steps to get into

405
00:31:05 --> 00:31:07
programming much easier there is only
one thing that you have to download and

406
00:31:07 --> 00:31:12
install you don&#39;t also have to learn how
to use the command line in order to be

407
00:31:12 --> 00:31:17
able to forget

408
00:31:17 --> 00:31:25
by just following up on your point about
how important to with the four the

409
00:31:25 --> 00:31:28
number and the fact that if you don&#39;t
converted to a number then you get a

410
00:31:28 --> 00:31:34
program that runs but just as completely
the wrong thing this is part 3 which

411
00:31:34 --> 00:31:37
runs but then crashes with a useful
error message

412
00:31:37 --> 00:31:42
my question is why not use a language
that just doesn&#39;t give you a program at

413
00:31:42 --> 00:31:48
all and just give you useful type era
instead and not but I am very much not

414
00:31:48 --> 00:32:00
implying that you use Java that how is
it different to what might those

415
00:32:00 --> 00:32:07
yeah I mean I mean has school for four
or language like that and I mean it&#39;s

416
00:32:07 --> 00:32:12
more I i well yeah I resent the fact
that you implied that we all like Python

417
00:32:12 --> 00:32:17
here I consider it the best I consider
it the best of a bad bunch and firmly in

418
00:32:17 --> 00:32:27
the camp slightly less than a lot of yes
you know I i dun think dynamically typed

419
00:32:27 --> 00:32:31
languages right languages for people to
be using and therefore I don&#39;t think the

420
00:32:31 --> 00:32:38
right languages would be a hell of alot
easier to teach if we declared the types

421
00:32:38 --> 00:32:45
when we declared the variables if it was
likely that way because explaining that

422
00:32:45 --> 00:32:48
this variable is an end and this
variable is a string and that you can

423
00:32:48 --> 00:32:52
add them together is much easier when
each variable has interest-rate written

424
00:32:52 --> 00:32:55
next to it

425
00:32:55 --> 00:33:02
but they could not going to do that for
that having the type definition would

426
00:33:02 --> 00:33:05
make it easier to teach I have not been
on the language that is better to teach

427
00:33:05 --> 00:33:28
them

428
00:33:28 --> 00:33:35
I was just thinking about your idea of
an idea a better than I do but you know

429
00:33:35 --> 00:33:39
a lot of ideas for Python I think would
probably be why I have a palette for

430
00:33:39 --> 00:33:52
voted for discussing eclipse
four-by-four vehicle features and stuff

431
00:33:52 --> 00:33:56
but it is incredibly like just way too
many buttons way too many controls it is

432
00:33:56 --> 00:34:03
very confusing as back

433
00:34:03 --> 00:34:11
what I would like a syntax highlighting
it has to tell you whatever like which

434
00:34:11 --> 00:34:15
line the errors or on to be able to run
it in the same window so that you can

435
00:34:15 --> 00:34:20
see here is my code and here is my code
running at a minimum that would be that

436
00:34:20 --> 00:34:29
would be it has to be not painful to use
but very clean very simple and if you&#39;ve

437
00:34:29 --> 00:34:37
ever seen from the Rugby Park Foundation
gave a really great united Europe Ivan

438
00:34:37 --> 00:34:45
last year and also I can distribute this
year with us here and why large part of

439
00:34:45 --> 00:34:47
what we talked about was here all the
different things that people use my

440
00:34:47 --> 00:34:50
views of why they all suck this is what
I wanted and I D

441
00:34:50 --> 00:34:59
talk to her thanks very much for talking
by the way the Twittersphere education

442
00:34:59 --> 00:35:04
people are already frothing at the mouth
video of the stock because they know

443
00:35:04 --> 00:35:08
they&#39;re already looking at crocko.com
and so that&#39;s good i was just wondering

444
00:35:08 --> 00:35:14
with regard to the teaching of teachers
in this very room a few years ago I was

445
00:35:14 --> 00:35:17
first introduced to something called
suffer carpentry I don&#39;t know if anybody

446
00:35:17 --> 00:35:20
years come across that but it&#39;s a
Canadian run effort but it&#39;s an

447
00:35:20 --> 00:35:27
international and international program
designed to teach primarily scientists

448
00:35:27 --> 00:35:31
how to make better use of computing so
they can amplify their research

449
00:35:31 --> 00:35:35
capabilities and also do things properly
rather than as you pointed out running

450
00:35:35 --> 00:35:41
the whole lot of code badly and the
sufferer carpentry trains people to

451
00:35:41 --> 00:35:47
become teachers so they get people into
a three-day camp where they learn the

452
00:35:47 --> 00:35:51
command line other on Linux on the Mac
and Windows doesn&#39;t do it and they have

453
00:35:51 --> 00:35:56
they learn then immediately get and then
they weren&#39;t books which actually I

454
00:35:56 --> 00:35:59
think to a certain extent will address
some of the idea questions that you also

455
00:35:59 --> 00:36:01
have simply

456
00:36:01 --> 00:36:10
Jennifer breasts have but anyway so it
would be interesting to see whether you

457
00:36:10 --> 00:36:14
guys could have joined forces with
suffer carpentry to instruct teachers

458
00:36:14 --> 00:36:18
because the curriculum materials are all
in and get up there all of them they&#39;re

459
00:36:18 --> 00:36:36
all kind of Commons license to another
was a question about typing and

460
00:36:36 --> 00:36:40
functional programming and that kind of
stuff I totally agree that i think is

461
00:36:40 --> 00:36:49
probably the best language to teach but
we have plans to teach kids more than

462
00:36:49 --> 00:36:57
one which do you mean some thought about
what other than in my opinion it should

463
00:36:57 --> 00:37:01
be a highly synchronous

464
00:37:01 --> 00:37:10
like the opposite of ten fifteen years
armelle once everyone wants teaches a

465
00:37:10 --> 00:37:13
comfortable teaching one paradigm of
programming that maybe we would it would

466
00:37:13 --> 00:37:16
be cool to also teacher functional
language in schools as well and maybe

467
00:37:16 --> 00:37:20
next time we update the curriculum in 20
years it will be only one language isn&#39;t

468
00:37:20 --> 00:37:23
enough we should also learn a new
language I don&#39;t think that is feasible

469
00:37:23 --> 00:37:27
at this time but it is a very
interesting idea and if there was a

470
00:37:27 --> 00:37:33
teacher that was very keen to be
teaching that that would be that would

471
00:37:33 --> 00:37:36
be completely supported by the
curriculum its language independent I

472
00:37:36 --> 00:37:42
would like to go back to my favorite
diagram this one where

473
00:37:42 --> 00:37:46
the functional paradigm as a sort of
problem solving and way of thinking be

474
00:37:46 --> 00:37:50
fascinating for the kids that love the
problem solving and algorithms side the

475
00:37:50 --> 00:37:54
it does not necessarily help you so much
rebuilding cool stuff that then you can

476
00:37:54 --> 00:37:58
show off to your friends and there would
be a little bit hesitant about that but

477
00:37:58 --> 00:38:04
if it was in conjunction with another
language as well so in terms of number

478
00:38:04 --> 00:38:13
of languages required to deal with
women&#39;s maybe Papa J&#39;s kind of scary to

479
00:38:13 --> 00:38:30
be honest it is how I remember vividly
in high school when we were doing

480
00:38:30 --> 00:38:36
physics they told us that atoms were
made up of this big ball of something

481
00:38:36 --> 00:38:43
currents know that they were electrons
which looked like parents or possibly

482
00:38:43 --> 00:38:47
raisins inside and then the next year
they said forget everything we told you

483
00:38:47 --> 00:38:52
last year was a lie there actually like
the subsystem around and then I believe

484
00:38:52 --> 00:38:58
if I keep going to university forget
everything you got old friend later on

485
00:38:58 --> 00:39:08
energy and so the question is are you
sure that applies to teaching kids

486
00:39:08 --> 00:39:12
programming that you may want to teach
them functional but that&#39;s kind of maybe

487
00:39:12 --> 00:39:17
the third year lie you should start with
the really simple lines say a python

488
00:39:17 --> 00:39:18
gonna give you everything you need

489
00:39:18 --> 00:39:25
gonna need the function actually we like
you gonna need a second future of

490
00:39:25 --> 00:39:28
fundamental I have this problem and I
break it down into a series of steps

491
00:39:28 --> 00:39:29
that then the computer can

492
00:39:29 --> 00:39:34
and that is a huge step and that will
give them a big advantage later on as I

493
00:39:34 --> 00:39:41
go to university and then study actual
programming

494
00:39:41 --> 00:39:56
interested in examining what the
students have done and I found when I

495
00:39:56 --> 00:40:01
went to school that the examination of
wasn&#39;t really that great but I really

496
00:40:01 --> 00:40:01
enjoy it

497
00:40:01 --> 00:40:04
things like Google Code Jam but you
actually get the problems that are

498
00:40:04 --> 00:40:08
interesting and you have to solve them
in a certain time so things like that

499
00:40:08 --> 00:40:12
might be good to look into if you&#39;re
running against the wall

500
00:40:12 --> 00:40:20
how do we examine this is an interesting
question a lot of exams are still at

501
00:40:20 --> 00:40:24
school will be done on people&#39;s
programming language they&#39;re likely to

502
00:40:24 --> 00:40:30
be doing exams in programming language
as well the the sort of cross school

503
00:40:30 --> 00:40:35
exams if there are any in the future the
way this is done at the moment in a

504
00:40:35 --> 00:40:41
language independent way is by doing so
tiger diagrams and exam but yes I agree

505
00:40:41 --> 00:40:44
would absolutely absolutely be much
better to have sort of online timed

506
00:40:44 --> 00:41:03
exams were you right card and you can
actually run the card before

507
00:41:03 --> 00:41:13
I they just like that diagram you had
the attitude because it is actually

508
00:41:13 --> 00:41:16
doing things one of the things I think
the people in this room because we both

509
00:41:16 --> 00:41:20
programs or programs in many
prescription is we&#39;ve already a tree

510
00:41:20 --> 00:41:27
full dissolves into one particular spot
in the complete set of types of ways of

511
00:41:27 --> 00:41:37
thinking about problems and so do you go
talking to your 22 teachers to start to

512
00:41:37 --> 00:41:44
twitch she tryna find you know different
angles and ways of doing it how are you

513
00:41:44 --> 00:41:47
getting good feedback are you she
communicating well with the teachings of

514
00:41:47 --> 00:41:54
industry generally yes running online
courses we have essentially a set of

515
00:41:54 --> 00:41:58
forums where the kids can ask questions
and so we get very very immediate

516
00:41:58 --> 00:42:00
feedback on what the kids are
understanding and what they&#39;re not

517
00:42:00 --> 00:42:04
understanding based on the questions
that were getting in the form of them we

518
00:42:04 --> 00:42:06
help him through you can find better
ways of explaining things to different

519
00:42:06 --> 00:42:11
kids as we go through we also get a lot
of feedback from peaches on on what they

520
00:42:11 --> 00:42:15
like and what they don&#39;t like we&#39;ve had
teaches been who&#39;ve been using our

521
00:42:15 --> 00:42:22
system for final six years now and we
get and if there&#39;s anything that they

522
00:42:22 --> 00:42:27
talk like that we find out very quickly
and we did a lot of feedback from them

523
00:42:27 --> 00:42:39
yeah there&#39;s a lot of surprises on very
basic question how many students are

524
00:42:39 --> 00:42:44
using your system roughly at the moment
and not so basic what kind of

525
00:42:44 --> 00:42:47
demographics other

526
00:42:47 --> 00:43:16
and range quite significantly shorter
than what I wanted to do was that we

527
00:43:16 --> 00:43:27
have four different levels of difficulty
and then we have what we call newbies

528
00:43:27 --> 00:43:43
beginner intermediate and advanced and
newbies

529
00:43:43 --> 00:43:51
we have nearly as beginners intermediate
and advanced are four different levels

530
00:43:51 --> 00:43:57
of difficulty newbies is usually primary
school kids but we have kids up to sort

531
00:43:57 --> 00:44:11
of grades five and six and the way
question

532
00:44:11 --> 00:44:24
good example has three round one of the
later ones so this is actually a set of

533
00:44:24 --> 00:44:31
blocks that click together but then
generate hyphen so this is what we start

534
00:44:31 --> 00:44:35
the beginners on women in the sort of
primary school age and this school bars

535
00:44:35 --> 00:44:43
ok so you have for example the first
line is finding to a variable with some

536
00:44:43 --> 00:44:46
import and that generates about them
directly there there as you&#39;re you&#39;re

537
00:44:46 --> 00:44:55
changing the blocks around editing the
pipeline right in front of you we find

538
00:44:55 --> 00:44:58
this is a good way to transition kids
into actually doing so we don&#39;t start

539
00:44:58 --> 00:45:01
pipe and directly necessarily with the
sort of you five and six kids but that

540
00:45:01 --> 00:45:06
is where we stopped the other ones are
just plain writing Python mcguiness

541
00:45:06 --> 00:45:12
thoughts out with just a little world
importing cars up two lists and

542
00:45:12 --> 00:45:15
intermediate not to be faster

543
00:45:15 --> 00:45:20
advancers quite advanced and goes
through interest in computer science we

544
00:45:20 --> 00:45:30
do have a huge range of abilities but we
have different levels and so are the Wii

545
00:45:30 --> 00:46:05
rain delay from great 524 grade 6 to
grade 13 in the New Zealand great see ya

546
00:46:05 --> 00:46:15
ambitions to cross the ditch National
Computer Science Museum and students

547
00:46:15 --> 00:46:18
it&#39;s all online for those nothing really
stopping anyone in the world from

548
00:46:18 --> 00:46:22
participating in it and we&#39;ve got a
whole bunch of kids museum we have quite

549
00:46:22 --> 00:46:25
a few schools from New Zealand as well
but I do have quite a few people just

550
00:46:25 --> 00:46:31
doing the courses not through the
challenge from competition with it very

551
00:46:31 --> 00:46:35
structured time frame works well as a
motivator

552
00:46:35 --> 00:46:39
here is you have to stop the course now
if you get a lot more people that way

553
00:46:39 --> 00:46:42
than just having a good all the time
when people say hey this is called last

554
00:46:42 --> 00:46:47
night later in the third time as well

555
00:46:47 --> 00:46:57
international programming and I should I
schools and stuff but more time for one

556
00:46:57 --> 00:47:12
more question

557
00:47:12 --> 00:47:18
test that I saw you doing on the invoice
and from the kind of mistakes he said

558
00:47:18 --> 00:47:22
they were made it seem like a lot of
that kind of thing is just what would be

559
00:47:22 --> 00:47:26
picked up on by people using order
completion obviously people in this room

560
00:47:26 --> 00:47:28
would argue that the crutch I wonder
like what&#39;s your opinion that like do

561
00:47:28 --> 00:47:32
you think that&#39;s an important feature
that have you had a chance to do any

562
00:47:32 --> 00:47:40
testing whether it helps that and that
would be interesting to find out that is

563
00:47:40 --> 00:47:46
one of the big differences between the
blocks and coding and I think yourself

564
00:47:46 --> 00:47:51
as the blocks are all here and you can
look them up and find the book that you

565
00:47:51 --> 00:47:54
need and then just put it in rather than
having to remember how to type

566
00:47:54 --> 00:48:00
everything but the blocks obviously get
annoying to use and having we haven&#39;t

567
00:48:00 --> 00:48:03
done any experiments with order to see
if that would help because we don&#39;t have

568
00:48:03 --> 00:48:07
an order to sleep system built into that
would be an interesting experiment to

569
00:48:07 --> 00:48:19
run if you can rely on order order to
plead in the early problems then if

570
00:48:19 --> 00:48:21
they&#39;re not fully understanding the
concept later that could be a real

571
00:48:21 --> 00:48:25
problem but again it could also just
avoid kids getting started throwing

572
00:48:25 --> 00:48:30
their hands up in frustration giving up
to you please join me one more time in

573
00:48:30 --> 00:48:31
thinking Katie Bell for her
