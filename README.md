# SrtToTextgrid
Python script to convert .srt subtitle files to Praat .textgrid files. It's general enough that it *may* work on other types of files like .sub or .sbv, but please be cautious.

Written in Python 2.7.3, may not work in Python 3. 

Example file is a .srt file based on a Youtube transcription of Katie Bell's keynote at a 2015 meeting of the New Zealand Python User Group. Url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj9RR4BSqvM
